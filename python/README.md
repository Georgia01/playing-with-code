# Python Notes

Place to dump useful notes for later related to Python

## Styling
- [PEP8 Style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Should indent using **4 spaces** - no tabbing unless that is there already. Python won't allow mixing
- Class and Type names should use CapWords convention
- Function and variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
